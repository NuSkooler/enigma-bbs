If you've become convinced you would like a "production" BBS running ENiGMA½ a more advanced installation
may be in order.

[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) is an excellent choice for managing your running ENiGMA½ instances if
you've installed via the [install script](install-script.md) or [manual installation](manual.md) method. 
Additionally, it is suggested that you run as a specific more locked down user (e.g. 'enigma').

If you're running ENiGMA via Docker, then process management is already handled for you!
