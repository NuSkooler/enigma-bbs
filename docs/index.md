# Introduction
ENiGMA½ is a modern from scratch BBS package written in Node.js.

# Quickstart
TL;DR? This should get you started...

## The Easy Way
Under most Linux/UNIX like environments (Linux, BSD, OS X, ...)  new users can simply execute the `install.sh` script to get everything up and running. Simply cut + paste the following into your terminal:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuSkooler/enigma-bbs/master/misc/install.sh | bash
```

For other environments such as Windows, see **The Manual Way** below.

## The Manual Way
For Windows environments or if you simply like to do things manually, read on...

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version **v6.x or higher**
  * :information_source: It is **highly** suggested to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your Node/io.js installs
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7.x
* A compiler such as Clang or GCC for Linux/UNIX systems or a recent copy of Visual Studio ([Visual Studio Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx) editions OK) for Windows users. Note that you **should only need the Visual C++ component**.
  
 
### New to Node
If you're new to Node.js and/or do not care about Node itself and just want to get ENiGMA½ running these steps should get you going on most \*nix type enviornments (Please consider the `install.sh` approach unless you really want to manually install!):

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 6
nvm use 6
```

If the above completed without errors, you should now have `nvm`, `node`, and `npm` installed and in your environment.

For Windows nvm-like systems exist ([nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), ...) or [just download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

  
### Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NuSkooler/enigma-bbs.git
```

### Install Node Modules
```bash
cd enigma-bbs
npm install
```

## Generate a SSH Private Key
To utilize the SSH server, a SSH Private Key will need generated. This step can be skipped if you do not wish to enable SSH access.
```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ./misc/ssh_private_key.pem 2048
```

### Create a Minimal Config
The main system configuration is handled via `~/.config/enigma-bbs/config.hjson`. This is a [HJSON](http://hjson.org/) file (compiliant JSON is also OK). See [Configuration](config.md) for more information.

#### Via oputil.js
`oputil.js` can be utilized to generate your **initial** configuration. **This is the recommended way for all new users**:

```bash
./oputil.js config new
```

(You wil be asked a series of basic questions)

#### Example Starting Configuration
Below is an _example_ configuration. It is recommended that you at least **start with a generated configuration using oputil.js described above**.

```hjson
{
	general: {
		boardName: Super Awesome BBS
	}

	loginServers: {
		ssh: {
	    	privateKeyPass: YOUR_PK_PASS
	    	enabled: true /* set to false to disable the SSH server */
	    }
	}

	messageConferences: {
		local_general: {
			name: Local
			desc: Local Discussions
			default: true

		    areas: {
		    	local_music: {
					name: Music Discussion
					desc: Music, bands, etc.
					default: true
	        	}
	        }
	    }
	}
}
```

## Launch!
```bash
./main.js
```

## Monitoring Logs
Logs are produced by Bunyan which outputs each entry as a JSON object. To tail logs in a colorized and pretty pretty format, issue the following command:
    
    tail -F /path/to/enigma-bbs/logs/enigma-bbs.log | /path/to/enigma-bbs/node_modules/bunyan/bin/bunyan

ENiGMA½ does not produce much to standard out. See below for tailing the log file to see what's going on.

## Points of Interest
* Default ports are 8888 (Telnet) and 8889 (SSH)
  * Note that on *nix systems port such as telnet/23 are privileged (e.g. require root). See [this SO article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16573668/best-practices-when-running-node-js-with-port-80-ubuntu-linode) for some tips on using these ports on your system if desired.
* **The first user you create via applying is the SysOp** (aka root)
* You may want to tail the logfile with Bunyan. See Monitoring Logs above.

# Advanced Installation
If you've become convinced you would like a "production" BBS running ENiGMA½ a more advanced installation may be in order. 

[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) is an excellent choice for managing your running ENiGMA½ instances. Additionally, it is suggested that you run as a specific more locked down user (e.g. 'enigma').
