## Style & Formatting
* In general, [Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used. See the [Prettier installation and basic instructions](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) for more information.
* Though you'll see a lot of older style callback code, please utilize modern JavaScript. ES6 classes, arrow functions, and builtins.
* There is almost never a reason to use `var`. Prefer `const` where you can and and `let` otherwise.
* Save with UNIX line feeds, UTF-8 without BOM, and tabs set to 4 spaces.
